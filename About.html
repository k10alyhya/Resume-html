    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Khaled AlYahya, a final-year Computer Science student at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University. I'm passionate about technology, problem-solving, and constantly exploring new tools and techniques in software development.

  One of my key projects is the PSAU Parking Optimization System, which aims to improve campus parking management by intelligently assigning parking spots based on studentsâ€™ class schedules. The goal is to reduce congestion and make better use of available parking spaces.
  
  I'm actively looking for opportunities where I can grow, apply my skills, and contribute to building smart, efficient tech solutions.</p>
